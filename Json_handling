to transfer data between two systems mostly it is json:


Read json to a file:
--------------------
import json

with open ("data.json","r") as file:
data=json.load(file)
print(data)


Write json to a file:
--------------------
import json
data={"name":"charan","god":"baba"}
with open("output.json","w")
json.dump(data,file,indent=4)

indent --- space
